# TimeTable
Project realised by *Marie PAYET* and *Flavien DELANGLE* during our studies at Telecom Lille.

Language : **JAVA**

Goal : Creation of a TimeTable with a MVC structure and good programming habits.

You can find the code on Github [here](https://github.com/flaviendelangle/TimeTable).

Location of the documentation : */JavaProject/doc/index.html*

This timetable can work with either a **XML** or a **SQL** storage. The choice is made by changing the value of the attribute *SQLactivated* in the class *TimeTableDB*.
